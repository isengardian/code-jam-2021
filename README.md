<!-- BUILT WITH  -->

## Built With

- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Since all the solutions are implemented with Java, so there's nothing else to be setup except that.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Java 11 setup in your local machine before you can run any one of the programs. Check out the [official guide from Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) for that.
